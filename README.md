5 papers written in **Amath 482 computational methods in data science** with Matlab. <br />
- The first assignment used **Fast Fourier Transform** to find the center frequency and location of a moving submarine by analyzing and denoising data with a **Gaussian filter**.  <br />
- The second assignment focused on obtaining frequencies of music recordings in the time domain by applying **Gabor transformation**. <br />
- The third assignment analyzed four sets of oscillation scenarios with **PCA** and examined the effects of the number of POD modes. <br />
- The fourth assignment compared the accuracy rate of **SVD**, **a linear classifier**, and **a decision tree classifier** on classifying the MNIST dataset. <br />
- The fifth assignment performed the **SVD** and **DMD algorithms** to decompose two video clips. A low-rank and a sparse approximation are used to separate the foreground and background video. <br />
